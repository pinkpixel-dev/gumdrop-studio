# Changelog

All notable changes to **Gumdrop Studio** are documented here.

## 2025-10-24

- Added the `Pixel Stamp ⬛` tool for precise single-cell placement and made it the default selection on startup.
- Smoothed out pointer handling so single-pixel strokes no longer streak across the canvas.
- Tuned the light theme palette to a softer cream gradient and ensured the pixel grid retains contrast in both themes.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new tool and interface adjustments.
